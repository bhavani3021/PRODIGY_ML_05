**Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation Model**


_Overview_:
This project involves the development of a machine learning model designed to accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content. The goal of this model is to assist users in tracking their dietary intake and making informed food choices by providing detailed nutritional information.

_Features_:
Food Item Recognition: Identifies various food items from input images.
Calorie Estimation: Estimates the calorie content of recognized food items.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a straightforward way to input images and receive nutritional information.

_Technologies Used_:
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries and Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV
NumPy


_Dataset_:
The dataset used for this project is the Food-101 dataset. It contains 101 different categories of food, with 1,000 images per category.

_Project Structure:_
Data Preparation: The dataset is downloaded and extracted, and the images are preprocessed for model training.
Model Development: The model is built using the InceptionV3 architecture, fine-tuned for the food classification task.
Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on the dataset, and its performance is evaluated using standard metrics.
Calorie Estimation: After classification, the calorie content of the identified food item is estimated based on predefined values for each food class.

_Results_:
The model should be able to classify food items with high accuracy and provide a reasonable estimate of their calorie content, helping users manage their diet effectively.
